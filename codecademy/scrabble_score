Define a function scrabble_score that takes a string word
as input and returns the equivalent scrabble score for that word.

Assume your input is only one word containing no spaces or punctuation.
As mentioned, no need to worry about score multipliers!
Your function should work even if the letters you get are uppercase, lowercase, or a mix.
Assume that you're only given non-empty strings.




solution:

def scrabble_score(str):
    total = 0
    str = str.lower()

    for l in str:
        total += score.get(l)

    return total
    
    
    
    or
    
    
    
    def scrabble_score(str):
    total = 0
    str = str.lower()

    for l in str:
        total += score[l]

    return total

print(scrabble_score("Abgada"))

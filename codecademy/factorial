Define a function factorial that takes an integer x as input.
Calculate and return the factorial of that number.

factorial(4) would equal 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, which is 24.
factorial(1) would equal 1.
factorial(3) would equal 3 * 2 * 1, which is 6.


solution:

def factorial(x):
    total = 1

    while x > 0:
        total *= x
        x -= 1
    return total

Define a function called purify that takes in a list of numbers,
removes all odd numbers in the list, and returns the result.
For example, purify([1,2,3]) should return [2].

Do not directly modify the list you are given as input;
instead, return a new list with only the even numbers.



solution:


def purify(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 == 0]

Write a function called censor that takes two strings,
text and word, as input.
It should return the text with the word you chose replaced with asterisks. For example:

censor("this hack is wack hack", "hack")
should return:

"this **** is wack ****"
Assume your input strings won't contain punctuation or upper case letters.
The number of asterisks you put should correspond to the number of letters in the censored word.






solution:


def censor(text, word):
    word_len = len(word)
    new_asterisks_word = ""

    for i in range(word_len):
        new_asterisks_word += "*"

    return text.replace(word, new_asterisks_word)

Define a function called product that takes a list of integers
as input and returns the product of all of the elements in the list.
For example: product([4, 5, 5]) should return 100 (because 4 * 5 * 5 is 100).

Don't worry about the list being empty.
Your function should return an integer.




solution:


def product(ints):
    total = 1
    for n in ints:
        total *= n

    return total

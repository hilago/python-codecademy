Write a function called digit_sum that takes
a positive integer n as input and returns the sum 
of all that number's digits.
For example: digit_sum(1234) should return 10 which is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4.
(Assume that the number you are given will always be positive.)



solution:

def digit_sum(x):
    total = 0

    while x > 0:
        total += x % 10
        x = x // 10 
        
    return total
